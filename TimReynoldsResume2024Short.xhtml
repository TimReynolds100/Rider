We did so very successfully implementing several AI Expert Systems. </p><p class="P47"> </p><p class="P46">At Avista Utilities I have continued architecting industry award-winning solutions delivering exceptional value to Avista.  I have done this consistently and successfully at the team level where the rubber meets the road; where high value architecture design and integration is put to the test, implemented, deployed and maintained on schedule and within budget. </p><p class="P47"> </p><p class="P46">I have been working with Jeff Burr, my Gartner Relationship Associate, to keep abreast of IT and Utility Industry models, architectures, changes and opportunities (i.e. Case Study: Creating a Valuable IT Architecture in an Agile Development Environment).</p><p class="P47"> </p><p class="P46">As of January 2015 I am a certified "Professional Scrum Master I" allowing me to work effectively with other SCRUM teams, product owners, solution architects, the LESS team for enterprise release coordination, and with production operations and support teams.</p><p class="P47"> </p><p class="P46">I worked on the ATLAS project integrations with GIS COTS architecture; specifically the ABB Service Suite service order processing system including the Mobile code and data deployment system.  I developed the GIS COTS architecture integrations during a week-long integration workshop with other solution architects including CSS, Maximo, Enterprise Integration, AFM/GIS, ABB, and other ATLAS project members.  </p><p class="P47"> </p><p class="P46">The Service Suite Architecture integration Visio diagram I produced was used to document all the integrations with project teams and with the Mobile workforce architecture as well.  It was used to secure an approval from the ETER Technical review and to specify the hardware that has now been fully deployed for all environments. </p><p class="P47"> </p><p class="P46">We set up up the Oracle databases for the last three environments and the suite of ABB servers for each environment.  All these servers conform to the latest security specifications including service accounts for each server and Active Directory (LDAP) logging and passwords.  </p><p class="P47"> </p><p class="P46">We have integrated with the service order development team allowing them to complete much of their testing even prior to message integrations with CC&amp;B and Maximo.  I received training from ABB in Service Suite Server management and maintenance.  I am also working with TC Technologies to integrate some of their components into our Mobile Viewer application supporting our field workforce.</p><p class="P47"> </p><p class="P46">When it comes to architecture, I have been a major contributor on every team I have been with at Avista since 1994.  During that entire time, I have aggressively pioneered and successfully delivered enterprise application level architectural solutions for Avista/GIS starting with the Regional Dispatch Monitor which blazed the trail for our GIS Outage Management solution.  We followed that up with an entire suite of innovative and ground-breaking ESRI/GIS applications at Avista.  </p><p class="P47"> </p><p class="P46">For converting the Avista Utilities Gas and Electric facility to enable GIS application development, the AFM team received the coveted “SAG” award (Special Achievement in GIS chosen from more than 100,000 organizations for excellence and innovative use of GIS technology). Now that's the caliber of solution architecture I've already helped delivered for Avista and the caliber I expect to continue delivering.  Our gas model, data architecture, data conversion, and geodatabase implementation has stood the test of time; still delivering exceptional value for over more than a decade.</p><p class="P47"> </p><p class="P46">Avista Corp. formerly Washington Water Power (WWP) is a gas and electric utility, with over 357,000 electric and 317,000 gas customers across four western states. I successfully architected, developed, QA tested and deployed Avista’s enterprise wide Gas Facility Data Conversion in four months. I was a member of the Electric Data Conversion Team as well. Using geo-located ESRI Coverages and shape files as primary source data, we delivered a full featured, state-of-the-art ESRI Geodatabase conforming to the ESRI Gas Utility Model (Telvent’s Model). </p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P49">I have been a member of the Avista Facilities Management Team (AFM) since 1994 and have been a major contributor for many of their valuable ESRI based Geospatial Solutions, underlying architectures, and database management systems. The AFM team worked closely with Telvent and ESRI to develop a common shared Gas and Electric Model for Utility data conversion and application development. Avista’s electric model varies in that it is more fine-grained allowing a conductor for each A, B, or C phase to enhance Outage Management and switching capabilities. The Gas Model is very similar.</p><p class="P15"> </p><p class="P51">The AFM team has covered virtually every aspect of geodatabase design and implementation. It has exercised this functionality from projection and Orthos to constraints and multi-version views. No effort was spared and no relevant functionality left unturned in our two decade quest to deliver a truly exceptional and full featured suite of GIS applications for Avista.</p><p class="P16"> </p><p class="P53">When we converted our Avista suite of GIS applications from VB to C# we were about 17 members strong with two Microsoft MVP contributors and international outsourcing. During this time I completed the ESRI ArcGIS upgrade of our entire AFM application suite to ArcGIS 10Sp4 and developed the system architectures for our mobile GIS applications.  These applications are all now C# .Net framework 4.0 supported by Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise Edition with Team tools and TFS source control. We use an Agile Software Development Model with test driven design. Avista’s suite of ESRI GIS applications includes: Outage Management, Gas and Electric Edit, Gas and Electric Design, Gas and Electric Service Orders, Gas and Electric Trouble, Compliance, Engineering Analysis, Map Production, Street Lights, Forestry, Real Estate, Claims, Metering, Mobile Gas and Electric order processing including trouble calls and compliance inspections and reporting, and several SmartGrid technologies (Grid-based Continuous Meter Monitoring, Individualized Energy Delivery with localized controls, and Automated Feeder Switching for instantaneous energy response, notification, and restoration).

By passing an object instead of multiple </span><span class="T6">parameters I was able to encapsulated behavior and actions into that object and greatly simplify the code. I created 128 automated testing tasks to test and validate these web services are function correctly after each code release. This web service is a candidate for a rewrite with the newer .NET technologies. Nevertheless, it is working correctly and effectively now.

There are more types of trouble to process than service order types. It required more editing forms. The repair information takes another route back to an enterprise web service that creates service orders as required and will route this order back to the remote device that reported the trouble so the crew can both identify and complete the trouble work. Otherwise, it will be dispatched to the best matched crew based on location and crew type.</span></p><p class="P26"> </p><p class="P48"><span class="T1">AFM Gas and Electric Service Orders for Mobile Devices: </span><span class="T6">Worked with end users to design,</span><span class="T1"> </span><span class="T6">develop, and deploy a new tool for AFM Mobile to field Gas and Electric service orders dispatched to remote crew devices via and Ventyx application called Mobile Application (MA). I wrote an interface service to the MA which sends these orders to the AFM Mobile application. Once there I coded the application to process these orders and locate them to the service points where the work was performed. Some of the data is reported back to the MA while the rest of the data including its</span></p><p class="P25"> </p><p class="P73">coordinates are stored locally and then sent via a Call Manager service to a Web service that stores them centrally. Once there the data is further processed by a Work Server (where installing or removing services or changes to other facilities are edited into a geodatabase session), Compliance Server, QA Posting server.</p><p class="P20"> </p><p class="P61"><span class="T1">Migrated all AFM applications to ESRI Direct Connect Data Access model: </span><span class="T6">Designed, developed,</span><span class="T1"> </span><span class="T6">and deployed all AFM/GIS applications using ESRI Direct Connect geodatabase access technology moving them off ESRI’s old SDE Service connection technology.

Assessors are first responders when there is significant or wide ranging damage to facilities. These assessors report on specific facility status and trouble incidents which are geo-located to office area and standard crew locations. Then they are presented on the Outage Management screen so they can be dispatched at the proper time to specific crews.

It uses Oracle custom locking stored procedures with synchronization and deadlock avoidance mechanisms. It is a core component of our AFM Outage Management System and has delivered an impressive 24/7 uptime of 99.79% since its deployment in 2001. I also developed a</span><span class="T5"> </span><span class="T6">monitoring service which automatically restarts any non-responsive server and logs, emails, and pages any errors based on error severity.</span></p><p class="P29"> </p><p class="P58"><span class="T1">AFM Outage Management System: </span><span class="T6">An outage management system for Central Dispatchers</span><span class="T1"> </span><span class="T6">replacing their paper based systems. This is an ESRI ArcInfo system with an Oracle geodatabase. It is coded in Visual Basic. This system handles both Gas and Electric outages. It covers both overhead and underground feeders at the phase level enabling a full featured switching model. It automatically rolls up instances to isolating devices and enables dispatchers to make real-time switching actions greatly facilitating the restoration effectiveness of field crews. Both the modeling by conductor phase </span><span class="T6">and my scalable server innovations have truly made this Outage Management Solution one the most reliable and effective in the industry. This is the application for which we received the ESRI Special Achievement Award.</span></p><p class="P20"> </p><p class="P52"><span class="T1">SmartMaps Gas Facility Management: </span><span class="T6">This GIS system was written in Oracle Forms, ArcInfo, and</span><span class="T1"> </span><span class="T6">AML. It allowed gas designers to design facility with standardized unit assemblies. I also helped Avista generate its own custom set of Work Management assemblies patterned after IBM’s standard compatible units. These unit assemblies where highly leveraged across several core applications and will be key to Avista’s current implementation project of IBM Maximo.</span></p><p class="P15"> </p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">Regional Dispatch Monitor: </span><span class="T6">This system was developed entirely by me and on my own initiative after</span><span class="T1"> </span><span class="T6">Avista electric facility was devastated by a hundred year ice storm event. It is a limited Outage Management System based on current incoming trouble calls geo-located by street segment and house number. It also supported filtering based on trouble call information fields like trouble type, trouble reason, zip code, etc. It was used by Central Dispatchers as a vast improvement to paper based processed until we finished geocoding our electric facilities and built our state-of-the-art AFM Outage Management System. It was also effectively used to replay and analyze the ice storm damage. Among other things, it showed Avista the types of areas that are critical for tree trimming efforts in order to avoid excessive damages in the future. I was given special corporate recognition for this effort and it helped Avista realize the value of geo-located facilities moving these solutions to the fore front and accelerating their pace. It used ESRI MapObjects, ArcInfo, IBM Visual Age Smalltalk, and COM object wrappers.</span></p><p class="P30"> </p><p class="P2"><span class="T1">Work Management System: </span><span class="T6">Work Management Systems are highly complex and very expensive.</span><span class="T1"> </span><span class="T6">They cost around 40M and many attempted developments had failed due to the massive number of unit assemblies, standards, and crew work activities to be managed. Fortunately our system was expertly designed by EDS Knowledge Engineers from the EDS Artificial Intelligence Services Group at General Motors. We used the same OOA/OOD skills used on GM’s expert systems. As one of those Knowledge Engineers I helped Avista create and customize a smaller subset of IBM’s vast number of standardized compatible units. We called them Unit Assemblies and Macro Unit Assemblies. This assembly subsystem has been leveraged by many other core Avista applications. That is an extreme amount of trust to be placed in the hands of one Knowledge Engineer but working closely with the business and by making the system highly extensible and updatable we achieved excellent results and this exceptional system has served Avista well and is still in place today. Initially, this system managed Gas, Electric, and Tree Trimming Crews. Now it manages virtually all facility work performed at Avista including trouble orders, inspections, and compliance.
